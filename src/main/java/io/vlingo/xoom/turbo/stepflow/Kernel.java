/**
 * <p>Kernels implement state machines and validate state mutations by comparing the current state of an object to a
 * desired state. Kernels do not tightly couple themselves to event messages. Event messages do not directly inform the
 * state of an entity, rather, handlers are responsible for accepting or rejecting a state-carried transfer. The kernel
 * is a consumer and producer of state mutations that are subscribed to by a collection of handlers.</p>
 *
 * <p>A kernel has a collection of input states that map to output states. When a state transfer is received by a
 * kernel, it can either accept or reject the request. A state transfer is applied to the underlying adapter during
 * validation by the kernel. If the underlying storage reflects a different state of an entity than the input state,
 * the state transfer will be rejected as a part of a transactional guarantee provided by the storage
 * implementation.</p>
 *
 * <p>Kernels do not tightly couple to storage implementations. The processor must provide a transactional function to
 * the kernel. The transaction will compare the input state (stale read) to the actual state. This guarantees that any
 * stale reads are rejected.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Kernels implement state machines that version an entity as mutations are applied. All state mutations are
 * applied in a linear order, and are guaranteed to replicate the state of an entity. Versions of an entity are
 * incremented whenever a state mutation is accepted by the kernel. Output states can equal their input states.
 * A field update to an entity may not require a logical state transition. A valid input state could be a list or none.
 * When no input state is provided, the logical state will remain the same while the versioned state will be
 * incremented.
 * </p>
